# thisismystuff
(a clever name if there ever was one)

This repository is meant to serve as a personal and professional portfolio for my data analytics programming skills and knowledge.

It is intended to be representative of my past and current skillset(s) as I continue to learn and build upon them to improve myself.

Nothing contained within this respository is intended to represent work that I have performed on a certain project or projects. Unless otherwise noted, I have selected mostly random or interesting datasets from Kaggle or other places on the internet with which to play and transform/manipulate data with Python, R, SQL, and other such tools.

Feel free to peruse. Feel free to critique. Feel free to contact.

I hope you enjoy.

Signed, Taylor
